notation: a,b = sequential; a-b - rock, a+b - roll

idea 1 (basics):

  r s             e i
a ↓ ↑ t         n ← → o
         ⇧   ␣

idea 2 (leftnav, righteye):

  r s             e i
a ↓ ↑ t         n ◉ ◎ o
←     →  ⇧   ␣

idea 3 (bs-enter):

   r s             e i
 a ↓ ↑ t         n ← → o
⌫      ◎  ⇧   ␣  ◉     ↵


curved home row
⇧ is both a hold-mod (for stay-in-layer stuff) and a tap-shift
␣ is both a hold-mod (for stay-in-layer stuff) and a tap-space
home row and space are modifiers themselves and only output on release
rolls roll though, only rocks (back-and-forth) form new combos
same-key rocks are preferred
arrows aren't modifiers and have key repeat


--- let's focus on the basics one first ---

  r s             e i        more compact
a ↓ ↑ t         n ← → o    --------------->  a r s t      n e i o
         ⇧   ␣                                 ↓ ↑   ⇧  ␣   ← →


⇧,⇧ is ??? (window focus toggle? workspace toggle? one-handed mode? eyetracker clicking? caps lock? shift lock? reserved for future use?)
⇧-␣ is enter, ⇧+␣ is (underscore is wasteful @ 0.23%)
␣-⇧ is backspace, needs key repeat

⇧-←, ⇧-→ are move-by-word, needs key repeat
⇧+←, ⇧+→ are ???
⇧-↓, ⇧-↑ are ???
⇧+↓, ⇧+↑ are home-end
␣-↓, ␣-↑ are page up / page down, need key repeat
␣-←, ␣-→ rocks are ???  (eat-word and tab?)

'[arstneio],space,up,down,left,right,enter,backspace' = 53.5%

[arst] - [←→] = various brackets, with popularity based on finger strength

s - ↑ = z because 1) mnenonics 2) 2nd rarest letter 3) same-finger is hard
i - → = j because 1) mnenonics 2) rarest letter 3) same-finger is hard
⇧ - ↑↓ = page up/down, but ␣ - ↑↓ are tmux page up/down (when in term)
␣ - arstneio = WM- or app- specific controls (spammables)
⇧ - arstneio = WM- or app- specific controls (spammables)
⇧ + ␣ = more controls (non-spammables)
  (how about ^A ^R ^C ^D   ^L ^U ^? ^Z in the terminal,
             ^A ^R ^S ^T   ^N ^W ^Q ^F in GUI apps?)
⇧ + ␣ + ⇧ = combo mode
⇧ + ␣ - ? = digits while ␣ is held. '.' is also available, ⌫  (vanilla, pity)
i - n = ing␣ because popular trigram and almost always ends the word (no caps tho)
⇧ + i - n = ing (IDK how good is that idea)
e - n = h (1.2) because 1) inward curl 2) strong finger. ngrams matter a lot:
 n - e = he because 'he' (.32) is 2x more popular than its 'the' subset
 n - a = ha because 'ha' is also .16
 t - n = th because 'th' is .37, 2.3x more popular than its 'the' subset!
 s - n = sh because it's .22
r - s = c (1.9) because 1) inward curl 2) strong finger, consonant-y
 r - o = co because it's .31!
s - r = l (1.5) because 1) consonantey, pairs with vowels
                  2) strong finger, inwards though
 a - r = al (1.9) because 1) a is left-hand 2) mnemonic
r - t = w because 1) inward rock 2) rightwards motion 3) w is more than half
                  vi: w, vi: :w. Will be less used with ⇻ and ⇍ instead of ^W
s - t = d because 1) inward rock 2) strong finger 3) consonant-y
 e - t = ed␣ (.25), ⇧ + e - t = ed (not sure how good the space idea is)
 n - t = nd (.13) - first to go away if needed
t - s = p - pairs with vowels and with r as 'pr'
i - e = u - pairs with consonants and with o as 'ou'
 o - e = ou
 o - t = ould?
? = g
